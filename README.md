# Green Kitchen

! NOTE: Green Kitchen project is still in its sprouting phase. After leave of absence ended, i was given access to LMS again and 10 days for late submission of PP4. Due to short time allocated, unfortunately i could not process study material and make project on time, although im very happy with my personal progress and understanding of coding, and im starting to have much more fun :D looking forward to resubmit it proper! thank you

! Project was based on unfinished template of module 'I think therefore i blog' from CI, all credits to it

## Introduction

Green Kitchen is place where progressive ideas cook. Topics of health, self-awareness, sustainability. Ancient wisdom is always just taking new forms. We are in a constant dialogue of the past, present and future.

Site concept is a personal blog with news section and a recipe page. Users can participate in comments on posts and news articles, with ability to like, upvote or downvote. They can also post recipes on recipe page.

All activities are supervised by admin which can delete comments or remove posts, post new blogs, etc..

## UX 

### User Stories

### Wireframes

These wireframes are intial vision of project that turned out to be much simpler. Nevertheless i attach them here as guidance for future work and updates.

I put more love in these wireframes than in any wireframes before! For making them [Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/) was used which i explored in more details on this occasion which was fun!

### Code

Project is based on LMS module template: 'I Think Therefore I Blog'.

I was mainly inspired and learnt trough LMS modules, slack and other students project examples.
Going trough different project codes and seeing similar patterns over and over again made me grasp things better.
