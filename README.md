# Green Kitchen

! NOTE: Green Kitchen project is still in its sprouting phase. After leave of absence ended, i was given access to LMS again and 10 days for late submission of PP4. Due to short time allocated, unfortunately i could not process study material and make project on time, although im very happy with my personal progress and understanding of coding, and im starting to have much more fun :D looking forward to resubmit it proper! thank you

! Project was based on unfinished template of module 'I think therefore i blog' from CI, all credits to it
